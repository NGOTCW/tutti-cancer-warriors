If records are hard to grab, a signed statement from a healthcare provider or social worker works too. Proof is needed upfront to ensure every grant goes to a real cancer warrior and meets audit standards. All documents are kept confidential.</p><p><strong>Data Protection:</strong> TCW processes personal data in accordance with <strong>EU GDPR</strong> (Regulation 2016/679).

Introduction</h3><p>At Tutti Cancer Warriors, we understand the power of shared experiences and compassionate connections.

How It Works</h3><p><strong>Application Process:</strong> Whether you’re a <strong>Warrior</strong> (currently undergoing cancer treatment) or a <strong>Survivor</strong> (who has completed treatment), we welcome you to apply to participate in our Peer Support Program. Warriors receive support from someone who has walked a similar path. Survivors offer their experience and strength to someone currently battling cancer. We match Warriors with Survivors based on shared experiences and needs.</p><p><strong>Communication Channels:</strong> Once you’re matched, the communication will take place through phone calls, video calls (Zoom or another platform), or online messaging (if applicable). All communication will be focused on emotional support, guidance, and shared experiences related to cancer.</p><h3>3. Respectful and Safe Environment</h3><p>We ask that all participants approach conversations with respect, understanding, and kindness. Our program is based on empathy and the understanding that cancer journeys are deeply personal.</p><h3>4. Guidelines for Participation</h3><h4>For Survivors:</h4><ul><li><strong>Offer Support:</strong> Provide empathy, guidance, and emotional support to warriors based on your own experience.</li><li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Keep any information shared by the warrior strictly confidential.</li><li><strong>Boundaries:</strong> Respect the warrior’s boundaries and understand the limits of the support you can provide.
